# Recommender Systems Series

This repository serves as a companion to the blog series on recommender systems published on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@eliasah). The series provides an in-depth exploration of recommender systems, from the basics to advanced techniques and implementations.

## Blog Posts

1. [Introduction to Recommender Systems: A Personalized Experience](https://medium.com/@eliasah/introduction-to-recommender-systems-a-personalized-experience-839b63a5e98f)
2. [Delving Deeper into Recommender Systems: From Basics to State-of-the-Art](https://medium.com/@eliasah/delving-deeper-into-recommender-systems-from-basics-to-state-of-the-art-d92ee8e277f2)
3. [Deep Dive into Matrix Factorization for Recommender Systems: From Basics to Implementation](https://medium.com/@eliasah/deep-dive-into-matrix-factorization-for-recommender-systems-from-basics-to-implementation-79e4f1ea1660)
4. Introduction to Recommender System Evaluation Beyond Accuracy (Not published yet)

## Repository Structure

- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks containing code examples and implementations from the blog posts.
- `/data`: Sample datasets used in the notebooks and examples.
- `/docs`: Additional documentation and resources related to recommender systems.

## Datasets

The `/data` directory contains sample datasets used in the examples and notebooks. These datasets are provided for educational purposes and may not be suitable for production use. For real-world applications, you should use larger and more comprehensive datasets relevant to your specific domain.

## Contributing
